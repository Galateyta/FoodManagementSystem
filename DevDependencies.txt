1. Compile code using - " g++ main.cpp Menu/Menu.cpp Order/Order.cpp Authentication/Authentication.cpp utils/Utils.cpp Profile/Profile.cpp calculations/Calculations.cpp Analytics/Analytics.cpp -lmysqlclient -lcurl" command.
2. Make sure the orders table the created during registration with the name - "ORDERS".
3. Make sure to have a "MENU" table with these columns in the same order - ID(text), DishName(text), OilCount(int), FryingLevel(text).
4. ID of the menu item should be equal to the id of the current signed user. You can change it in the main.cpp while calling the fillOrderData function.

RESTAURANTS table in the sql should look like this in this exact order - ID, Username, Password, RestaurantName, Address, Email, Role, MaxOilCount, CurrentOilCount, Coefficient, Frequency.
ORDERS table in sql should look like this in this exact order - ID, DishName, Date, OilCount, Count, FryingLevel
